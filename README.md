**This is not gamesense.pub cracked or anything, this is simply a recreation of gamesense.pub that was pasted together by somebody.**
If I'm correct it seems to be Legendware with a gamesense menu framework.

### **Original sources**
>https://github.com/dani1368/IdaLovesMe (Menu framework)
https://github.com/CSGOLeaks/Legendware-V3 (The cheat)

### **Dependenices**
These are required or cheat will crash put them in these locations.

"gsws" and "luas" folder in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive"
"sb" folder in "C:"

### **Crash troubleshoot**
* If you still crash after doing directories, comment out the whole void of c_lua::download_cloud_scripts() and line 76 of Clua.h file.

### **Updates?**
I've already begun fixing and changing various things in the sourcecode such as fixing the F in the tabs. I may upload my changes sooner or later, and treat this as a learning experience for C++ and CS:GO internals just play around with it!
